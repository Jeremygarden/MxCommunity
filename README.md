# MxCommunity



Web Dev Application Project

By jumping out a anti-social idea, I was initally dying for realizing what the core functionality of such a online private community.
Using Spring MVC Framework (DI concepts) and Hibernate Annotation, based on front-end implementation as well. 
User in the same group would see other's post. And get personal mood channel just like tweet.
